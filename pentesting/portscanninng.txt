1. Passive information gathering
I investigated the domain "guiltygear.com". It can be found at the IP address 54.192.58.80.
I'm not allowed to view the true expiration date, but the registrar expiration date appears
to be the 13th of November, 2022. I found that the netblock owner of the website is Amazon, and that 
the english version of the site is almost certainly hosted somewhere within the UK. The browser 
runs JavaScript when on the site, and they registered the domain with godaddy in Tempe, Arizona. 
All other information about the registrant seems to be kept private by godaddy, via their partner
"domains by proxy."


2. Host detection
When I scanned the local network, I didn't find any active hosts; nmap scanned 256 different addresses but 
didn't find anyone, maybe because my local network is within my dorm. However, I can still speak about what 
nmap did for each individual address. It seems like vmware begins by sending out a broadcast, asking "Who has 
[IP address]? Tell [kali's ip address]" Next, it recieves the MAC address of the IP it's checking, and also recieves
a packet from the resident of the IP informing kali what the machine it's running on is called (in this case, my desktop). 
After confirming that it's not an actual host, nmap seems to move on to the next potential host. 

When scanning on the carleton network, things went a bit differently. There were three hosts up:
elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu at (137.22.4.5)
perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu at (127.22.4.17)
maize.mathcs.carleton.edu at (137.22.4.131)

This time, nmap begins by making a SYN request to the potential host, on both 443 and 80. The host responds with
SYNACKs, and the handshake is completed with an RST and ACK packet. This is notable because when no host was found, the SYN
packets were left unanswered, while the active hosts answered nmap's pings. The final message appears to be a "standard query"
from nmap, which is responded to with the name of the host in question. 

3. Port scanning
Metasploitable has the following ports open:
21/ftp
22/ssh
23/telnet
25/smtp
53/domain
80/http
111/rpcbind
139/netbios-ssn
445/netbios-ssn
512/exec
513/login
514/tcpwrapped
1099/java-rmi
1524/bindshell
2049/nfs
2121/ftp
3306/mysql
5432/postgresql
5900/vnc
6000/X11
6667/irc
8009/ajp13
8180/http

It seems like the two database servers are MySQL and PostgreSQL.

The value of the RSA SSH Hostkey is: 2048 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3.
The RSA SSH hostkey is used to "verify that the client is connecting to the correct host," according to BMC Software. 

Port 2049 has nfs, or Network File System. NFS is a file system protocol whose purpose is to let the user access 
files over a network like they might on their local machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System). 
Having now learned about this, I believe I've actually used this service in order to download files off of mantis
for my systems course last term.
