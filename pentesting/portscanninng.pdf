1. Passive information gathering
I investigated the domain "guiltygear.com". It can be found at the IP address 54.192.58.80.
I'm not allowed to view the true expiration date, but the registrar expiration date appears
to be the 13th of November, 2022. I found that the netblock owner of the website is Amazon, and that 
the english version of the site is almost certainly hosted somewhere within the UK. The browser 
runs JavaScript when on the site, and they registered the domain with godaddy in Tempe, Arizona. 
All other information about the registrant seems to be kept private by godaddy, via their partner
"domains by proxy."


2. Host detection
When I scanned the local network, I didn't find any active hosts; nmap scanned 256 different addresses but 
didn't find anyone, maybe because my local network is within my dorm. However, I can still speak about what 
nmap did for each individual address. It seems like vmware begins by sending out a broadcast, asking "Who has 
[IP address]? Tell [kali's ip address]" Next, it recieves the MAC address of the IP it's checking, and also recieves
a packet from the resident of the IP informing kali what the machine it's running on is called (in this case, my desktop). 
After confirming that it's not an actual host, nmap seems to move on to the next potential host. 

When scanning on the carleton network, things went a bit differently. There were three hosts up:
elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu at (137.22.4.5)
perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu at (127.22.4.17)
maize.mathcs.carleton.edu at (137.22.4.131)

This time, nmap begins by making a SYN request to the potential host, on both 443 and 80. The host responds with
SYNACKs, and the handshake is completed with an RST and ACK packet. This is notable because when no host was found, the SYN
packets were left unanswered, while the active hosts answered nmap's pings. The final message appears to be a "standard query"
from nmap, which is responded to with the name of the host in question.
