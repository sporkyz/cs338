Part 1
Total time: 1m5.974s
Number of hashes computed: 267733 
Passwords cracked: 2805
Time per hash computed: 0.00024641713946357 seconds
Time per password cracked: 0.023520142602495543 seconds
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 0.01047685567337608

Part 2: I ran my code for an hour without finding a single password, so I'm doing 
the timing based on how long it took my code to run through 5 first words.

Total time:  4m8.741s
Number of hashes computed: 1070932
Passwords cracked: 0
Time per hash: 0.000232265914 seconds
Time per password: N/A
Passwords cracked per number of hashes: N/A, but it's definitely less than the first part. 

Part 3:
Total Time: 21m43.774s
Hashes Computed: 750991065
Password Cracked: 2804
Time per hash: 0.00000173607125405679 seconds (less than part 1!)
Time per password: 0.4647 seconds



Analysis:

- I'm not sure what factor the time per password changed by since I couldn't find any for parts 2 and 3, 
but I know for sure that the time was much larger going from part 1 to the later parts, given that I ran 
parts 2 and 3 for longer than I ran part 1 and got no passwords. The number of possible passwords in 2 was
larger than 1 by a factor of around 3,000,000 so that's probably why it took longer there, and there were nearly
3000 times as many hashes in part 3.
